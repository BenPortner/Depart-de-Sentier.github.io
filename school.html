        <p>Life cycle assessment is often partitioned along three axes: technology, space, and time. However, most LCA studies and databases have only a rudimentary incorporation of temporal aspects. In this autumn school, we will build on open source tools to systematically analyse how incorporating temporal aspects can change our results and provide better decision support.</p>
        <p>In our first module on Monday, we will use <a href="https://github.com/polca/premise">Premise</a> to incorporate future scenarios into inventory data to create consistent future databases. These scenarios can be global and cover the whole economy, or focus on specific sectors or technologies. You will learn how to develop your own user scenarios, and how to efficiently analyse your future databases.</p>
        <p>In our second module on Tuesday, we will use <a href="https://github.com/brightway-lca/temporalis">Temporalis</a> to add temporal distributions to individual inventory datasets, and study how such distributions can be used in LCA calculations. We will then include temporal aspects in impact assessment as well, moving from single score impact assessment results to impact timelines.</p>
        <p>In addition to the main modules, there will also be shorter inputs throughout the week on other topics in open source sustainability assessment like hybridisation and sensitivity analysis.</p>
        <p>From Wednesday to Friday, you will work in groups of five and apply these ideas in group projects. Each group will have a dedicated instructor. Groups will present their results on Friday afternoon.</p>
        <p>This autumn school is primarily aimed at PhD and postdocs students who are studying or using life cycle assessment, but others are also welcome to apply. Students who complete the school will receive a certificate for 2 ETCS credit points. Enrolment is limited to 30 people.</p>
        <p>The school is organised by <a href="https://www.d-d-s.ch/">Départ de Sentier</a>, a nonprofit association which supports open sustainability assessment and public engagement.</p>

        <h5>Brightway introduction</h5>
        <p>Some basic understanding of Python will be necessary. We also offer a half-day introduction to Brightway on the Sunday before the school starts.</p>
        <h5>Starting and ending times</h5>
        <p>The school starts at 10:00 on Monday and formally ends at 16:00 on Friday, though you are invited to an Apéro on Friday evening. The Sunday introductory course starts with lunch at 12:00.</p>
