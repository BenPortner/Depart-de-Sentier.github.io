        <p>Open source tools have dramatically increased our ability to realize the potential of life cycle assessment. We have tools for simple calculations, uncertainty and sensitivity assessment, parametric modelling and interfaces to external models, inclusion of spatial and temporal information, generation of new databases for scenarios and prospective LCA, hybridization of multiple databases and database modelling perspectives, and much more. In this spring school we will build on these open source foundations, including Brightway and Premise, to make our inventory models better able to answer our research questions.</p>
        <p>The exact schedule of the course will be determined early in 2024, and will build on the latest software developments available. The following themes will be included in the Spring School:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Prospective LCA</li>
          <li>Spatial disaggregation</li>
          <li>Inclusion of trade data and MREEIO</li>
          <li>Sensitivity analysis to support inventory revision</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The structure of the school starts with two days of interactive teaching sessions using Jupyter Notebooks. These notebooks include exercises, and we will discuss the solutions in class. From Wednesday to Friday, you will work in groups of five and apply these ideas in group projects. Each group will have a dedicated instructor. Groups will present their results on Friday afternoon.</p>
        <p>This autumn school is primarily aimed at PhD and postdocs students who are studying or using life cycle assessment, but others are also welcome to apply. Students who complete the school will receive a certificate for 2 ETCS credit points. Enrolment is limited to 25 students.</p>
        <p>The school is organised by <a href="https://www.d-d-s.ch/">Départ de Sentier</a>, a nonprofit association which supports open sustainability assessment and public engagement, with support from the <a href="https://ciraig.org/">CIRAIG</a>.</p>

        <h5>Location</h5>
        <p>The summer school will be held in the <a href="https://monastere.ca/">Monastère des Augustines</a> in central Québec City, Canada. This restored monastery is a fantastic place for focused learning and working. We will all stay in the <a href="https://monastere.ca/en/accommodation">authentic rooms</a>.</p>
        <h5>Brightway introduction</h5>
        <p>Some basic understanding of Python is necessary for the school. Brightway has an <a href="https://documentation.brightway.dev/en/latest/">training and documentation online</a>, and we will offer a half-day online introduction to Brightway for course participants before the school starts.</p>
        <h5>Starting and ending times</h5>
        <p>The school sessions start at 9:00 on Monday and ends at 16:00 on Friday. We will offer a small reception for students on Friday evening.</p>
        <h5>Language</h5>
        <p>The summer school will be in English. The will be French-speaking instructors for groups who prefer French.</p>
        <h5>Course fees</h5>
